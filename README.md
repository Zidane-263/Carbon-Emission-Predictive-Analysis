# Carbon-Emission-Predictive-Analysis
# Objective
To develop a robust machine learning model for accurate carbon emission prediction from vehicles, leveraging historical data and real-time sensor information, with the aim of reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainable transportation practices.
# Environment Setup
Download the codebase and open up a terminal in the root directory. Make sure python 3.10 is installed in the current environment. Then execute, pip install -r requirements.txt
# Dataset Information
Fuel consumption: City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% highway) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)
CO2 emissions: the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometer) for combined city and highway driving
CO2 rating: the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
Smog rating: the tailpipe emissions of smog-forming pollutants rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best).
